### App Summary

* Eat-a-Burger! Is a fun app that lets a user input the name of a burger they want to eat.

* Once submitted, the burger is displayed in text on the left side of the page where it's waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Eat it!` button. Once clicked, the burger will move to the right of the page.

* Every burger entered is stored in the database
